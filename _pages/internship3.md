## Performance of concurrent algorithms: a carbon footprint perspective

### Tl;dr

* 2 to 6 months internship position at Univ. Grenoble Alpes (LIG laboratory)
* M1 or M2 internship
* Topic: Performance of concurrent algorithms
* Goal: Analyzing the carbon footprint of concurrent algorithms

### Context

In the context of global warming, reducing the carbon emissions of computer infrastructures is a top priority. Concurrent algorithms are at the core of computer software today as their purpose is to allow applications to take advantage of multi-core processors.

Different families of concurrent algorithms exists. For instance, we can classify algorithms depending on the progress guarantees they provide (blocking, lock-free, wait-free). The goal of this internship is to look at concurrent algorithms from another perspective: their carbon footprint. What does measuring the carbon footprint of concurrent algorithms means? Are they significant differences in terms of carbon footprint between different classes of algorithms? What are the characteristics of efficient algorithms from this point of view?

The goal of this internship is to try answering (at least partially) some of these questions.


### Location

The intern will join the Informatics Laboratory of Univ. Grenoble
Alpes (LIG), one of the largest laboratory in Computer Science in
France. Univ. Grenoble Alpes is one of the 50 best universities in the
world for computer science according to international rankings.

More specifically, the intern will work in the ERODS research team, that focus on the efficiency and robustness of distributed systems. ERODS is one of the top system research teams in France and in Europe, with publications in the most selective conferences of the domain.
