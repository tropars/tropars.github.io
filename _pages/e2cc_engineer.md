# Research Engineer: Developing techniques for anomaly detection at scale in Cloud-Edge platforms

## Context

Our team is involved in the  [E2CC European
project](https://e2cc.eu/). The goal of the project is to develop
standardized Edge-to-Cloud platform that ensures interoperability,
portability, and cybersecurity.

The project builds a hardware and a software stack for future
Edge-to-Cloud platforms. The core of the project is the development
of an orchestrator that simplifies the deployment and execution of
Edge applications, while minimizing energy consumption.

The E2CC project includes 14 academic and industrial partners. It is
part of the [8ra European Initiative](https://www.8ra.com/), that aims
at driving the development of a sovereign, interoperable, and secure
Multi-Provider Cloud-Edge Continuum.


## Objective

In the E2CC project, our team is in charge of developing techniques to
detect anomalies in Edge-to-Cloud platforms. By anomaly, we typically
refer to performance issues due to hardware or software faults
(defects, crash, bugs, missconfigurations, etc). These techniques
should be integrated into the E2CC orchestrator.

More specifically, we have 2 main objectives:
- Designing anomaly detection techniques that can take advantage of different sources of monitoring data (hardware, operating systems, applications) to make accurate detection
- Designing techniques that require little amount of monitoring data and minimize data transfers related to anomaly detection.

To this end, we want to take advantage of advanced machine learning techniques, and more specifically, on unsupervised learning techniques such as variational autoencoders.

## Mission

The recruited engineer will contribute to the following tasks:
- Design and build software solutions for anomaly detection in Edge-to-Cloud platforms
- Run tests in Edge and Cloud platforms to validate the accuracy and the performance of the developed solutions
- Collaborate with students on research topics related to the E2CC project
- Collaborate with members of the E2CC project (companies and academics) on the development of the E2CC orchestrator
- Participate to meetings and events related to E2CC and 8ra
- Participate to the every-day life of the KrakOs research time

### Location

The engineer will join the Informatics Laboratory of Univ. Grenoble
Alpes, one of the largest Computer Science laboratory in
France. He/she will work in the [KrakOs](https://lig-krakos.imag.fr/)
research team. KrakOs is a joint team between UGA and Inria.
