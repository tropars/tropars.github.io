## Energy efficiency and reliability in datacenters: is faster always better?

### Tl;dr

* 2-6 month internship position at Univ. Grenoble Alpes (LIG laboratory)
* M1 or M2 internship
* Topic: Energy efficiency of fault tolerance techniques in datacenters
* Goal: Analyze and compare the efficiency of different fault tolerance techniques in datacenters from energy point of view.

### Context

In the context of global warming, reducing the carbon emissions of computer infrastructures is a top priority. Datacenters are responsible for a large fraction of the carbon emissions of IT. Hence, the energy efficiency of datacenters needs to be improved. 

Datacenters provide a large set of services to users. Among other things, it implements different kinds of mechanisms to ensure the reliable execution of applications and the availability of data despite crashes. Until today, researches working on fault tolerant systems have tried to design solutions that maximize performance. However, is the most efficient solution performance-wise also the most efficient solution from energy point of view? The goal of this internship is to try answering this question.

### Mission

Please contact me for additional information

### Location

The intern will join the Informatics Laboratory of Univ. Grenoble
Alpes (LIG), one of the largest laboratory in Computer Science in
France. Univ. Grenoble Alpes is one of the 50 best universities in the
world for computer science according to international rankings.

More specifically, the intern will work in the ERODS research team, that focus on the efficiency and robustness of distributed systems. ERODS is one of the top system research teams in France and in Europe, with publications in the most selective conferences of the domain.
