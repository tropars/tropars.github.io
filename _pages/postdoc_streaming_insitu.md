# High-throughput stream processing in HPC systems for online data analysis


## Context

In-situ data analysis is an attractive solution to process the data
produced by large scale High Performance Computing simulations, as it
allows analyzing the data *online*, i.e., as soon as they are produced
[1, 2]. Analyzing data without flushing them first to a Parallel File
System improves the global performance of the system while allowing to
analyze larger portions of the data that are generated by the
simulations. As such, it has the potential to increase the scientific
knowledge that can be gained from the execution of numerical
simulations.

With the raise of *Big Data*, distributed stream processing engines
have become a major field of study. Several projects, such as Spark
Streaming, Storm, or Flink, have emerged with the goal of being able
to process large amount of data in real time. Due to their simple
programming model and their large ecosystem of users and libraries,
such tools can allow field scientists to easily analyze numerical
simulations data at scale [3].

Using Big Data stream processing engines for online data analysis in
the context of numerical simulations raises several challenges. The
two main questions are: (i) How to efficiently implement streaming
programs to analyze the data produced by numerical simulations? (ii)
How to adapt Big Data stream processing engines to take advantage of
the specific hardware of HPC systems and achieve the unprecedented
throughput required by numerical simulations?

### Mission

The postdoctoral researcher will integrate a research group including
faculty members and research engineers, and work in close
collaboration with PhD and master students on the topic of stream
processing for online data analysis. The goal of our team is to study
the ways to achieve high throughput for stream processing by taking
into account the particular needs of online analysis for numerical
simulations and by taking advantage of the specific hardware
technologies (high performance networks, fast non-volatile storage,
etc.) available in HPC systems.

This work will be run in the context of a national project involving
academic research groups as well as some major French IT companies.

### Location

The postdoctoral researcher will join the Informatics Laboratory of
Univ. Grenoble Alpes, one of the largest laboratory in Computer
Science in France. Univ. Grenoble Alpes is one of the 50 best
universities in the world for computer science according to
international rankings.
