<!-- #### Memory allocation for NVRAM -->

<!-- - M1 internship -->
<!-- - **Keywords**: NVRAM, fault tolerance, operating systems, performance  -->


<!-- NVRAM is a new memory technology that combines the non-volatile properties of disks with the performance of DRAM. NVRAM offers new opportunities to build efficient fault-tolerant systems, where the application state always remains in memory and still can be recovered after a crash. However, many challenges need to be solved to manage using NVRAM efficiently because its properties differ from DRAM. For instance, memory allocators need to be redesigned to ensure that allocated regions can be found again after a crash while providing high performance. To build resilient applications using NVRAM, our team is developing a new technique based on high-frequency checkpointing. The goal of the internship is to study strategies for efficient memory allocation in the context of high-frequency checkpointing in NVRAM. -->

<!-- #### Efficient checkpointing in NVRAM for in-memory key-value store -->

<!-- - M1 internship -->
<!-- - **Keywords**: NVRAM, fault tolerance, concurrent programming, KV store  -->

<!-- Using new NVRAM technologies, our team is building a solution based on high-frequency checkpointing to make multi-threaded applications crash-tolerant while ensuring very high performance. This internship focuses on in-memory key-value store (such as Memcached). In-memory KV stores are one important building block of large scale cloud applications and aim at improving the data access performance. The goal of the internship is to study how our high-frequency checkpointing solution should be adapted to work efficiently with in-memory KV stores. -->


<!-- #### Impact of new AMD architectures on fault tolerance in NVRAM -->

<!-- - M1 internship -->
<!-- - **Keywords**: NVRAM, fault tolerance, concurrent programming, processor architecture -->

<!-- New NVRAM technologies have been proposed by Intel. Among other things, NVRAM allow building very efficient fault-tolerant applications. New AMD processor architectures (Epyc) also include support for these NVRAM technologies but implementing fault-tolerant applications using NVRAM on new AMD processors has not been studied yet. The goal of this internship is to study the unique characteristics of new AMD processors and to assess their impact on the efficiency of fault-tolerant techniques based in NVRAM. The internship will start by focusing on solutions based on high-frequency checkpoints for fault tolerance, and could be later extending to other kinds of approaches. Data-intensive applications will be considered for the evaluations. -->


<!-- #### Data placement in servers equipped with NVRAM -->

<!-- - M1 internship -->
<!-- - **Keywords**: NVRAM, fault tolerance, operating systems, performance  -->

<!-- NVRAM is a new memory technology that combines the non-volatile properties of disks with the performance of DRAM. Hybrid servers that include both DRAM and NVRAM are now available. However, such architectures raise several questions regarding data placement. First, factors such as the memory module on which the data is physically located or the alignment strategy used for data stored in NVRAM can have a significant impact on performance in multi-core processors. Second, depending on the access pattern, it might be more valuable to store the data in DRAM or in NVRAM. The goal of this internship is to study data placement issues and strategies for such hybrid servers. To this end, we will consider the case of popular concurrent applications such as data-intensive applications or in-memory databases. -->
