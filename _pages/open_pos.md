PhD or a Postdoc on topics related to my research interests.


### PhD Positions


<!-- No funded position at the moment. -->

- **Towards self-healing large scale distributed systems based on digital twins**
  - [Detailed description]({{ site.url }}/_pages/phd_DT_AI.html)



### Internship offers

List of current internship offers (contact me for additional information):
- [A desaggregated scalable message broker based on NVRAM](#a-desaggregated-scalable-message-broker-based-on-nvram)
- [Energy-efficient computing with NVRAM](#energy-efficient-computing-with-nvram)

#### A desaggregated scalable message broker based on NVRAM

- M1 or M2 internship
- **Keywords**: NVRAM, fault tolerance, resource desaggregation, distributed systems 

Message brokers (such as Apache Kafka) are at the core of many large scale distributed infrastructures. They provide a flexible means to communicate between distributed entities in a fault tolerant way. However, message brokers can often become a performance bottleneck for large scale applications. On the other hand, NVRAM is a new memory technology that combines the non-volatile properties of disks with the performance of DRAM. The goal of this internship is to design and implement a new efficient message broker based on NVRAM. Approaches based resource disaggregation and relying on advanced features of modern networks will be studied.

#### Energy-efficient computing with NVRAM

- M1 or M2 internship
- **Keywords**: NVRAM, energy efficiency, parallel applications 


NVRAM is a new memory technology that combines the non-volatile properties of disks with the performance of DRAM. Furthermore, NVRAM has unique properties in terms of energy consumption since it consumes power only during data accesses. Hence, one can envision to design new algorithms that consume less energy than the legacy solution where all data are stored in DRAM. However, improving energy efficiency is not that simple because: i) in reality, NVRAM is a bit slower than DRAM; ii) writing to NVRAM is costly in terms of energy. Considering data-intensive applications, such as graph processing applications, the goal of this internship is to design and implement data placement strategies to make the best use of NVRAM to improve the energy efficiency of applications.
