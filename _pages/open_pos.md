#### Memory allocation for NVRAM

- M1 internship
- **Keywords**: NVRAM, fault tolerance, operating systems, performance 


NVRAM is a new memory technology that combines the non-volatile properties of disks with the performance of DRAM. NVRAM offers new opportunities to build efficient fault-tolerant systems, where the application state always remains in memory and still can be recovered after a crash. However, many challenges need to be solved to manage using NVRAM efficiently because its properties differ from DRAM. For instance, memory allocators need to be redesigned to ensure that allocated regions can be found again after a crash while providing high performance. To build resilient applications using NVRAM, our team is developing a new technique based on high-frequency checkpointing. The goal of the internship is to study strategies for efficient memory allocation in the context of high-frequency checkpointing in NVRAM.


#### Data placement in servers equipped with NVRAM

- M1 internship
- **Keywords**: NVRAM, fault tolerance, operating systems, performance 

NVRAM is a new memory technology that combines the non-volatile properties of disks with the performance of DRAM. Hybrid servers that include both DRAM and NVRAM are now available. However, such architectures raise several questions regarding data placement. First, factors such as the memory module on which the data is physically located or the alignment strategy used for data stored in NVRAM can have a significant impact on performance in multi-core processors. Second, depending on the access pattern, it might be more valuable to store the data in DRAM or in NVRAM. The goal of this internship is to study data placement issues and strategies for such hybrid servers. To this end, we will consider the case of popular concurrent applications such as data-intensive applications or in-memory databases.
