## A lightweight and general Machine-Learning model to predict micro-service resource consumption

### Tl;dr

* 2 to 6 months internship position at Univ. Grenoble Alpes (LIG laboratory)
* M1 or M2 internship
* Topic: Performance of micro-service applications
* Goal: Building a machine-learning model that can accurately predict the resource consumption of microservices, while requiring small amount of data to train and being able to generalize to new hardware.

### Context

As the micro-service application model becomes popular in the Cloud domain, more and more complex large-scale micro-services applications are deployed in datacenters [1]. For such complex applications, a challenge at execution time is to find a good hardware and software configuration, that can ensure expected performance without consuming to many resources. Another challenge is to adapt this configuration dynamically based on the current load experienced by the application.

In our team, we study how Machine Learning can help tackling this problem. Our approach is as follows: use our expertise and knowledge about the application to build accurate models that could work better than brute-force approaches that would consider the application as a black box. At the core of our approach is a model that, for a given micro-service, is able to predict the resource consumption of the service for a given load.

We have already developed such a micro-service model. It provides promising results. The goal of the internship is to study and design techniques to improve the capabilities of this model. Multiple challenges still need to be tackled. To be able to react fast to changes in the application, we would like a solution that is fast to train and re-train while keeping a high accuracy. We would also like to have a model that is able to generalize to new hardware. 

The goal of the internship is to work on improving this micro-service model.

### Location

The intern will join the Informatics Laboratory of Univ. Grenoble
Alpes (LIG), one of the largest laboratory in Computer Science in
France. Univ. Grenoble Alpes is one of the 50 best universities in the
world for computer science according to international rankings.

More specifically, the intern will work in the ERODS research team, that focus on the efficiency and robustness of distributed systems. ERODS is one of the top system research teams in France and in Europe, with publications in the most selective conferences of the domain.
